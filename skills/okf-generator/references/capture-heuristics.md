# Capture Heuristics Reference

## When to Capture Knowledge to OKF

### Strong Signals (Capture)

- User explicitly says "document this", "add to knowledge base", "save this decision"
- Architecture discussion with concrete components, flows, or design choices
- A decision was made with rationale — "we chose X because Y"
- Procedure or runbook was created or refined
- API endpoint, schema, or integration was designed or documented
- User shares a repo, wiki, or doc URL for reference

### Weak Signals (Maybe Capture — Ask First)

- Lengthy technical discussion that *might* contain documentable knowledge
- User describes a system but hasn't asked to document it
- Troubleshooting session that revealed useful patterns
- Configuration discovered through trial and error

### No-Capture Signals (Never)

- Casual conversation, greetings, small talk
- Model reasoning traces or chain-of-thought artifacts
- Temporary debugging output
- Sensitive data (credentials, PII) — reference only, never store values
- One-off questions with no lasting value

## Concept Splitting Strategy

When capturing from large sources:

1. **One concept per file** — atomic knowledge units
2. **Max ~500 lines** — split larger topics into sub-concepts
3. **Preserve hierarchy** — if the source has sections, map them to a directory structure
4. **Cross-link generously** — use markdown links in the body (e.g. `[users](/tables/users.md)`) to connect related concepts
5. **ID naming** — use path-style IDs: `domain/specific-topic` (e.g., `architecture/auth-flow`)
